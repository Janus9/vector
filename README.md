# vector
template-based dynamic array data structure (replica of std::vector) <br/>

push_front(element) -> insert element at front of vector <br/>
push_back(element) -> insert element at end of vector <br/>

pop_front() -> returns & deletes element at front of vector <br/>
pop_back() -> returns & deletes element at end of vector <br/>
pop(index) -> return & deletes element at index <br/>

peek_front() -> returns element at front of vector <br/>
peek_back -> returns element at end of vector <br/>
 
at(index) -> accesses element in vector at index for read/write with protection <br/>
[index] -> accesses element in vector at index for read/write without protection <br/>

print_vector() -> prints contents of vector to console <br/>
debug_vector() -> prints out debugging information to console containing vector size, template size, size &  <br/>

get_size() -> returns size of vector <br/>
get_capacity() -> returns capacity of vector <br/>
