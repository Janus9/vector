# vector
template-based dynamic array data structure (replica of std::vector)

push_front(element) -> insert element at front of vector
push_back(element) -> insert element at end of vector

pop_front() -> returns & deletes element at front of vector
pop_back() -> returns & deletes element at end of vector
pop(index) -> return & deletes element at index
peek_front() -> returns element at front of vector
peek_back -> returns element at end of vector

at(index) -> accesses element in vector at index for read/write with protection
[index] -> accesses element in vector at index for read/write without protection

print_vector() -> prints contents of vector to console
debug_vector() -> prints out debugging information to console containing vector size, template size, size & capacity
